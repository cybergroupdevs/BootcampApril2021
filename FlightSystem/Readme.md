Hi this is my Flight mangement System

First download or clone this repo on your system
Then create the required database and table using queries mentioned in DatabaseQueries
Then open the project.sln file in your Visual Studios and change the localhost according to your system
Then Scafold the database with your apis
Change the localhost in the javascript as well of your frontend
run the project

FYI : "There is some issue regarding the put and its authorisation as well i will resolve it soon in the mean time you can try the other methods and operation in the system"
