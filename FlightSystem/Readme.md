Hi this is my Flight mangement System

First download or clone this repo on your system<br>
Then create the required database and table using queries mentioned in DatabaseQueries<br>
Then open the project.sln file in your Visual Studios and change the localhost according to your system<br>
Then Scafold the database with your apis<br>
Change the localhost in the javascript as well of your frontend<br>
run the project<br>

FYI : "There is some issue regarding the put and its authorisation as well i will resolve it soon in the mean time you can try the other methods and operation in the system"
